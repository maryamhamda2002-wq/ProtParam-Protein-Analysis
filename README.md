# ProtParam-Protein-Analysis
Protein sequence analysis project using ExPASy ProtParam tool to study molecular weight, pI, stability, and hydrophobicity differences between normal and mutant proteins.
ProtParam-Based Protein Analysis Project
Overview

This project demonstrates the use of the ExPASy ProtParam tool for analyzing protein sequences. ProtParam is a widely used bioinformatics tool that predicts various physicochemical properties of proteins based only on their amino acid sequence. It is extremely useful for research in protein chemistry, structural biology, and bioinformatics.

Key Features of ProtParam

ProtParam provides several important properties of proteins:

Amino Acid Composition – Counts and percentages of each amino acid.

Molecular Weight – Total mass of the protein.

Theoretical Isoelectric Point (pI) – The pH at which the protein carries no net charge.

Atomic Composition – Distribution of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur atoms.

Extinction Coefficient – Useful for estimating protein concentration in solution.

Estimated Half-Life – Prediction of how long the protein is stable in different organisms.

Instability Index – Predicts whether the protein is stable or unstable in vitro.

Aliphatic Index – Indicates protein thermostability.

Grand Average of Hydropathicity (GRAVY) – Represents the hydrophobic/hydrophilic nature of the protein.

My Project Results

In this project, I analyzed two protein sequences (Normal vs Mutant) using ProtParam. The results revealed differences in:

Molecular weight (change due to amino acid substitution).

Isoelectric point (pI) (shift in protein charge behavior).

Stability parameters (instability index indicated that the mutant protein may be less stable).

Hydropathicity (mutation altered hydrophobicity, which can affect protein folding).

These findings highlight how even a single mutation can influence protein properties significantly.
